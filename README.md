# Missile Command
Project completed in 2019, in year 1 of MSci Computer Science degree.

A recreation of Atari's Missile Command (1980) built for Windows.

This project is written in C and uses the PDCurses library to support text-based graphics.

The aim of the game is simple: to protect civilisation from enemy missile barrages by intercepting them with counter-missiles.

Simply aim your mouse to decide where to launch a missile, and left-click to fire. Enemy missiles must be intercepted early, or they can fragment.
