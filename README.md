# Text-Based Missile Command
A recreation of Atari's classic arcade game, Missile Command (1980), developed for PC.

This project is written in C and makes use of the ncurses library to support text-based graphics.

The aim of the game is simple: enemy missiles fall from the sky and threaten your settlements and missile bases under your command; it is your job to protect these assets by intercepting these missiles with your own.

Simply aim your mouse to decide where to launch a missile, and click to fire. Enemy missiles must be intercepted early, or they can fracture and double the threat. Try to earn as many points as possible by being efficient with your missile supply and protecting your assets. 

But, commander, be warned... after surviving an assault of enemy missiles, another wave will begin its approach.
